### Class Hierarchy

**User Management:**
```
User (abstract)
├── Client - Self-service parking customers
└── Admin - Employee with management privileges
```

**Vehicle Management:**
```
Vehicle (abstract) implements Taxable
├── Car - Standard vehicle ($5/hour)
├── Truck - Large vehicle ($10/hour)
├── Bus - Commercial vehicle ($12/hour)
├── Van - Medium vehicle ($7/hour)
├── Bike - Two-wheeler ($2/hour)
├── EV - Electric vehicle ($4/hour with green discount)
└── Scooter - Small two-wheeler ($2/hour)
```

**Core Operations:**
- `ParkingSlot` - Manages individual parking space state
- `Ticket` - Tracks parking sessions and calculates fees
- `Report` - Generates analytics and usage reports
- `System` - Central coordinator for all operations

## 🎨 Design Patterns

Our implementation demonstrates key software engineering patterns:

| Pattern | Implementation | Purpose |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Polymorphism** | Vehicle fee calculation via `Taxable` interface | Different vehicle types calculate fees differently |
| **Inheritance** | User→Client/Admin, Vehicle→Car/Truck/etc | Code reuse and logical hierarchy |
| **Mediator** | System class coordinates all operations | Reduces coupling between components |
| **State** | Ticket lifecycle (active→paid→archived) | Clean state management |
| **Factory** | System creates User, Vehicle, Ticket objects | Centralized object creation |
| **Iterator** | Admin loops through Users to aggregate data | Clean collection traversal |

### Polymorphic Fee Calculation Example

```java
// Each vehicle type implements its own fee logic
class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    public double calculateFee(Duration duration) {
        return duration.toHours() * 5.00;
    }
}

class Truck extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    public double calculateFee(Duration duration) {
        return duration.toHours() * 10.00;
    }
}

// Ticket doesn't need to know vehicle type details
class Ticket {
    public double calculateTotalFee() {
        return vehicle.calculateFee(parkingDuration); // Polymorphic call
    }
}
```
